- Make a menu for it. (like for SwanEmu)
- Input code.
- Remove disassembler code. (We don't need it and that slows down things)

- Get rid of the Retroarch's specific code in libretro-common.
- Switch the core code to C ? Not trivial as it is fairly extensively used here.
TCLS emulation core is C, so is the Z80 emulation core.
mempatcher.cpp : A lot of C++ code could be removed, especially cheats.
So far the biggest roadblocker would be the APU and save state code.

From what i see, it is going to be a bit tricky... but we will have to get rid
of that code in any case if i want to make it more portable/workable.
