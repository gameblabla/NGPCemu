- It's a bit sluggish on the LDK and especially the RS-90.

Not sure how i can speed it up... Frameskipping ?
According to gprof, most of the time is spent on drawing tiles/sprites on-screen
so using frameskipping can save a great amount of CPU time.

However, we would also need to tweak the Audio code so it plays nice with the frameskipping
or else the audio will still sound like crap.

At the moment, only frameskipping is implemented.

- Switch the core code to C ? Mostly DONE.
Most of the code has been switched to ANSI C, except for the Audio code.
Unfortunately, it's not easily switchable because there are no C replacements for Stereo_Buffer.
At least it does not link against the C++ library.
